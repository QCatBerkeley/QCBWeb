                        Ever since the time of Turing, computer science has revolutionised the world, touching almost all aspects of daily life. For this reason, the classical bit occupies a position as one of the most fundamental advances in history. However, while this has led to drastic advances in many areas, there remain key problems that current computers do not have much to say about. The most famous example of these is the deceptively innocuous problem of breaking a number into its prime factors, which is actually extremely difficult to do efficiently with a computer. However, efficient solutions for such problems are easily doable on a quantum computer.
                        <br>
                        <br> Quantum computing is a dynamic area at the intersection of physics and computer science that reformulates computation via the deeply powerful and profoundly counterintuitive ideas of quantum mechanics. Using quantum mechanics as the basis for computing results in a huge expansion in the number of problems that we can solve efficiently. While there are many critical quantum ideas that are behind this, any discussion on quantum computing must talk about superposition. Let us consider a simple system which can be in either state A or B. What the superposition principle says is that in addition to being in A or B, the system could be in a combination (superposition) of A and B at the same time. Let's bring this abstract definition a bit more to life with the example of a coin, which has the states heads and tails as expected. If we used quantum mechanics to describe a coin, we are saying that there is also an infinity of states which is both heads and tails at the same time but with different amount of heads and different amount of tails. An elementary extension of this idea is the quantum bit or qubit. Whereas a classical bit is either 0 or 1, a quantum bit can have a certain amount of 1 and a certain amount of 0 at the same time.

                    <p class="lead">
                        <br> To begin to understand why superposition brings real advantages, we have to get a tiny bit technical. Suppose we had a computer powered by just 2 bits. The possible states 00, 01, 10, 11 and each bit is completely independent of the other. This means that to change the state, we have to do up to 2 operations potentially. Now consider a computer with 2 qubits. The possible states are still 00, 01, 10, and 11 but now we can have states like 00 + 01 also. The trick however is that superposition (and another effect called entanglement which we will talk about later) link the separate qubits so that they aren't independent anymore. Essentially, the quantum state encodes information about every qubit at once, so instead of having to change both qubits separately (which in many cases we cannot even do) we simply apply one operation to the combined 2 qubit state. So we have essentially gone from 2 operations to 1, which doesn't really sound that impressive but consider replacing a classic 64-bit computer with a 64-qubit computer. This computer has 264 - 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 - bytes. While a classic computer can require up to more than 18 quintillion operations, a quantum computer can act on all qubits with 1 operation. This ability to use all qubits as one is the key as it allows multiple qubits to interact with each other, with the net result being a process where the processes that lead to the solution we want reinforce each other while other bad solutions tend to cancel each other out.
                        <br>
                        <br> What does all this quantum weirdness buy us? Algorithms that could not only factor numbers efficiently but also break the RSA encryption that protects a vast proportion of modern communications. Artificial Intelligence that is enhanced by access to the infinity of quantum states that Nature provides access to at the microscopic level. These are only two of the many possible advances following a shift to quantum computing.
                        <br>
                        <br> However, quantum computing is still a young field and faces some major challenges. Chief among these is building an actual quantum computer on a real scale. Quantum states are incredibly fragile and the slightest interaction with the environment will break them. The result is that qubits will become classical bits and all the extra states will disappear - a phenomenon known as wavefunction collapse. Moreover, quantum gates (the analogues of classical gates such as and/or/xor) are more intricate to design since quantum effects must be considered. Currently Google leads the world with the 72 qubit <a target="_blank" href = "https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/a-preview-of-bristlecone-googles-new.html"> Bristlecone computer </a> released in April 2018.

                        <br> Others like IBM are intensifying their efforts and startups like Rigetti are also contributing significantly to creating an exciting ecosystem in the quantum computing space.
                        <br>
                        <br> Due to its young age and potentially revolutionary impact, quantum computing is one of the most dynamic and exciting fields today. Just as we learned to harness the bit, it seems virtually inevitable that we will harness its more exotic relative the qubit, which promises to bring about a computational transformation at least as profound as its venerable predecessor.
